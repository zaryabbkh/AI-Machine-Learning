### What is generative AI?

An artificial intelligence system that can produce high quality content, specifically **text, images and audio**.

### How generative AI works?
Generative AI generates text using Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are built using supervised learning.

#### Exmples of tasks LLMs can carry out
LLMs can be used in web app or software applications. Like search can be a web app but reading email is a software based application integreted into a system. 

1. Writing
    - Given a prompt the LLMs can write pretty good.
2. Reading 
    - LLMS can also read like read customer emails and mark them as complaint or not
3. Chatting
    - LLMs can be useful for buillding chat bots.

### Limitations of LLMs
- Knowledge cutoffs
- Hallucinations
- the input (prompt) (and output) length is limited
- Generative AI does not work well with structured (tabular) data.
- Bias and Toxicity

### Tips for promopting
- Be detailed and specific
    - Give sufficient context for LLM to complete the task
    - Describe the desired task in detail

- Guide the model to think through its answers

- Iteratively improving your prompt

### Image generation
Image generation is mostly done using **diffusion model**

The hear of diffusion model is **supervised learning**

Diffusion models are learnt from huge number of images found on the internet.
